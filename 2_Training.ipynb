    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The 2 sources i consulted are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/04/solving-an-image-captioning-task-using-deep-learning/\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/tree/master/tutorials/03-advanced/image_captioning\n",
    "\n",
    "I also consulted https://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html\n",
    "The link above clearly shows that resnet 152 would be a better choice than resnet 50; hence i decide to use that as my pretrained model. After doing further studies online, i decided to use batch normalization as well in my model(The reference for this has alos been provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not deviate much from the standard defaults. I chose an embedding size of 256 and i chose 512 hidden layers. I decided to use a batch size of 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had some challenges with the sample method. I realized that i needed a python list to be retuned so my return list has some \"hoops\" or \"tweaks\" and this can be seen in the model.py\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sampled_ids = torch.stack(sampled_ids, 1)\n",
    "return sampled_ids.squeeze().cpu().numpy().tolist()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing that i realized when i was in the testing phase was the generated captions can be less than 20 words. This is hassle; since once i get to \". <end\\>\", the sequence \". <end\\>\" kept repeating till 20 words. To deal with this; once i predict a \"1\" for end, I break from the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I left the tranform at its provided values. The images that are required are of dimensions (224,224,3). However, we can get input images of varying sizes but we want square images of size 224. Also we can get images of size smaller than height/width of 224 pixels. Hence we will need to resize to 256 and then crop to size 224. Therafter, we do a random horizontal flip with a probability of 0.5. The random horizontal flip is doen only during the training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally convert to a tensor and normalize. The normalization is based on the pretrained model and the values for resnet 50 and resnet 152 are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** In my case,i used batch normalization hence i needed to take care of this in my params list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.linear.parameters()) + list(encoder.bn.parameters())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder i used a pretrained resnet 152 model; hence the trainable parameters on the encoder are from the embedding layer and the batchn normalization layer. It is a good choice since i train all the available parameters in the decoder and paramters in the encoder that are not from the pre trained resnet 152 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  I used the Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.\n",
    "The reason for selecting Adam Optimizer is becuase i have tried this in other projects and it gave me good results; so it was natual to try the Adam Optimizer in this project as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the advantages of the Adam Optimizer are as follows. It is computationally efficient with little memory requirements. It is very well suited to problem with large amounts of data and parameters. It is also invariant to diagonal rescale of the gradients. Adam essentially combines the advantages of AdaGrad  and RMSProp.\n",

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
